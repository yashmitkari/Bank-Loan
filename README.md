## Bank-Personal-Loan-Predictor

## Introduction:
Using this dataset I am trying to predict if the customer should be given a personal loan or not.

## Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to use different ML models to predict the accuracy of granting a loan using the decison tree model. Data Visualizations are done using bar charts and plots for better understanding of the data. Some reduntant columns are dropped as it didn't affect the output.

## Dataset:
The data set includes 5000 observations and contains 5 different categories including age, experience, income, CC avg and mortgage.
